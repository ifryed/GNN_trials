## GNN Trials
by Shai

## First attempt
For my first attempt, I started with the CORA dataset and tried
to classify the topics of papers using a GNN.

I followed [Petar Veličković](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bkKi8Us7yevvP1KIBQHog)
excellent [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owQBFAHw7E) on the 
TensorFlow Channel and implemented the code in PyTorch 
(originally implemented in TensorFlow).

The task was to classifie papers catagory by using a word vector and a graph connecting papers to their citetions.
